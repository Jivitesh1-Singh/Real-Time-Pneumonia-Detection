Real-Time Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection

Project Description
This project implements a real-time data analytics pipeline using deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. A CNN model is trained and deployed as a Streamlit web application for real-time prediction.

Dataset
Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset (Kaggle)  
Reduced and balanced subset used for training.

How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py
